</div>
<div data-custom-style="paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="normaltextrun">The World Health Organization (WHO) states that ‘breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants’. Breastfeeding is beneficial to infants, mothers, families and society, and is viewed as the biological and social norm for infant and young child feeding. Exclusive breastfeeding ensures that the infant receives the full nutritional and other advantages of breast milk, including developmental benefits and protection against infection and some chronic diseases. <strong>Breastfeeding stimulates cognitive development and protects infants against diarrhoeal infections and pneumonia.</strong> It is recommended that infants are exclusively breastfed until around 6 months of age when solid foods are introduced, and that breastfeeding is continued until 12 months of age and beyond, for as long as the mother and child desire. All staff should be trained in infant feeding so that they can enable women and their families to make informed choices about infant feeding. They should provide ongoing support in order for parents to safely and responsibly feed and care for their babies.</span></p>

<h2 id="examination-findings">Examination findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> With the passage of meconium and loss of water by evaporation, an initial weight loss of up to 10% of the birth weight during the first week is normal. and by 2 weeks should have returned to his or her birth weight. In general, weight gain is assessed on a 4-week average: Birth to 3 months: a gain of 150–200 g a week; 3 to 6 months: a gain of 100–150 g a week; 6 to 12 months: a gain of 70–90 g a week.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><strong>Bowel actions:</strong> An infant’s first bowel actions consist of meconium, which is greenish-black. After 24–48 hours the meconium changes – first to brownish ‘transitional’ stools and then, by the third or fourth day, to typical breastfed infants’ stools, which are loose and mustard-yellow (sometimes with milk curds), Frequent, runny stools do not mean a breastfed infant has diarrhoea or lactose intolerance – they should simply be viewed as evidence of sufficient milk. The number of bowel motions of breastfed infants tends to decrease between 6 weeks and 3 months of age. Intervals of several days or more between stools are common. If the infant is receiving breast milk only and no other food or fluid, there is no cause for concern. Exclusively breastfed infants are rarely constipated.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="infants-under-the-age-of-6-months.">Infants under the age of 6 months. </h2>
<p>All mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies exclusively and should be <span data-custom-style="normaltextrun">provided with information about why exclusive breastfeeding leads to the best outcomes for their baby.</span></p>
<p>Mothers should be enabled to achieve effective breastfeeding according to their needs including appropriate support with positioning and attachment, hand expression and understanding signs of effective feeding. Encourage mothers to use expressed breast milk when away from the infant and breastfeed when mother and infant are together. Inform parents about the wide variation in normal bowel function in infants who are breastfed.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive feeding</strong> (previously referred to as demand feeding) is used to describe a feeding relationship which is sensitive, reciprocal and about more than nutrition. Mothers should be reassured that breastfeeding can be used to feed, comfort and calm babies or to ease maternal discomfort e.g. engorgement. Breastfed babies cannot be overfed or spoiled by too much feeding.</p>
<p>Offering <strong>supplementary feeds</strong> – water, glucose or infant formula – when there is no medical reason has been shown to adversely affect the establishment and maintenance of successful breastfeeding. If an infant is unable to take all feeds directly at the breast, expressed breast milk should be the preferred method of feeding. The use of supplementary feeds other than expressed breast milk is rarely necessary. Breastfeeding of preterm infants while in hospital is occasionally supplemented by formula feeding. Even if the mother does need to continue giving supplementary feeds indefinitely, she should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding before offering the supplementary feed. It should not be suggested that the infant be totally formula fed.</p>
<p>Exclusively breastfed infants do not require additional fluids up to 6 months of age.</p>

<h3 id="modified-feeding-regimes">Modified feeding regimes: </h3>
<p>There are a number of clinical indications for a short term modified feeding regime in the early days after birth. Examples include preterm or small for gestational age babies and those who are excessively sleepy after birth. Some other babies require additional medical support including babies with jaundice, babies who are compromised at birth-infection /hypoxic, babies of diabetic mothers.</p>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><strong>Partial breastfeeding:</strong> When exclusive breastfeeding is not possible, the value of continuing partial breastfeeding should be emphasized and mothers should be supported to maximize the amount of breast milk their baby receives. Mothers who give other feeds in conjunction with breastfeeding should be enabled to do so as safely as possible and with the least possible disruption to breastfeeding.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><strong>Formula Feeding</strong>: If an infant is not breastfed or is partially breastfed, commercial infant formulas should be used as an alternative to breast milk until 12 months of age. LBW infants, including those with VLBW, who cannot be fed mother&#39;s own milk or donor human milk should be fed standard infant formula until 6 months of age. VLBW infants who cannot be fed mother&#39;s own milk or donor human milk should be given preterm infant formula if they fail to gain weight despite adequate feeding with standard infant formula. Formula-fed infants may be given cooled boiled tap water, if additional fluids are needed.</p>

Administer 2 hourly feeds, with the remaining fluid requirement met by intravenous fluids.

<h2 id="introducing-solid-food">Introducing solid food</h2>
<p>Solid food should be started at around 6 months. At around this point, infants are physiologically and developmentally ready for new foods, and need more nutrients than can be provided by breast milk or formula. This is necessary to meet the infant’s increasing nutritional and developmental needs. By 12 months of age, a variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups is recommended.</p>
<p>Discourage mothers from using expensive, low nutrition supplements such as potato powder. Local paps – such as cuuroo (peanut / rice porridge), monoo (coos porridge) or corn/soya/bean mix are much cheaper and more nutritious.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for babies to refuse a new food the first time it is introduced. Mothers should try a food on at least 10 different occasions before they decide that a baby doesn’t like it.</p>

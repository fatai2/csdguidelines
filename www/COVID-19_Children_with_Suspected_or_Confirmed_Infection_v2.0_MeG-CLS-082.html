<div data-custom-style="paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="normaltextrun">Children &lt; 10 years old are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 virus than adults and children &gt; 10 years old. The infection in children is also associated with a less severe illness. The role of children in transmitting the virus to others is still unclear. Many children will be asymptomatic and those with symptoms are more likely to transmit the virus. Children with pre-existing medical conditions, particularly underlying cardiac or respiratory conditions or complex neuro-disability disorders may be more severely affected, although data for this is limited. Children may also have a mixed infection with another respiratory virus or a secondary bacterial infection. Most children should, however, recover 1-2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.</span></p>

<div data-custom-style="paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="normaltextrun">Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS or MIS-C) is a newly described condition, thought to be due to a delayed immune system response to SARs-CoV2. It can be very severe, requiring critical care and appears weeks after a COVID-19 infection. It has been described in several different countries but is thought to be rare.</span></p>

<p><span data-custom-style="normaltextrun">In outpatients, do not <strong>routinely</strong> examine any children’s throats during the COVID-19 pandemic as there are likely to be asymptomatic patients with pharyngeal carriage which increases exposure for healthcare professionals. It is reasonable to prescribe antibiotics for a possible streptococcal infection on the basis of history alone at this time</span>. If a child requires testing for COVID-19 then this should be done in full PPE according to SOP-AIR-007 for how to do nasopharyngeal and throat swabs to confirm infection.</p>
<p>Although most children will only have mild symptoms, it is important to specifically assess their:</p>

<p>If the child looks generally unwell (specifically with persistent fever, dehydration or suspected sepsis, signs of liver dysfunction or respiratory failure) then they should be investigated with full blood count, blood culture, LFTs and U&amp;Es as a minimum.</p>
<p><strong><span class="underline">Typical investigation results in COVID-19</span></strong></p>
<p>In COVID-19 you would typically see normal or reduced white cell count with low neutrophil and/or lymphocyte counts. Some patients will have low platelets too. In severe cases there may be elevated liver enzymes, if these persist then check coagulation as this may also be deranged. Liver function tests should not routinely be checked.</p>
<p>Radiological changes in children may be non-specific. Chest X-rays may show bilateral patchy airspace consolidation at the periphery of the lungs, peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities. Chest CT shows airspace consolidations and ground-glass opacities.</p>
<h2 id="management">Management </h2>
<p>The majority of children with confirmed COVID-19 can be managed with advice on hand hygiene, self-isolation and staying well hydrated. Hospital admission depends on national guidelines and whether the child requires oxygen therapy, feeding or fluid support or has a suspected bacterial infection.</p>
<h3 id="respiratory-care">Respiratory care</h3>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Oxygen therapy should be given if SpO2 &lt; 90%.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>If signs of severe pneumonia, shock, coma or convulsion aim for SpO2 ≥ 94%.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Infants and young children can use nasal prongs or cannula (maximum flow rate 2 L/min). Older children and adolescents should receive oxygen via a face mask. Face masks with reservoir bags should be reserved for those with severe disease to deliver 10 – 15 L/min. Head boxes or other devices to maximise oxygen delivery should be used where possible.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>CPAP is not currently available for children with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 although could be considered on a case-by case basis</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Children with asthma should be treated as usual but with salbutamol given via a spacer rather than nebulized to reduce the risk of aerosolisation of COVID-19. Oral steroids should be used as normal for children with asthma.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Proning should be used where possible to minimise oxygen requirement</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supportive-care">Supportive care</h3>
<p>Feeding and hydration are very important. If a child is not feeding well then nasogastric feeds or fluids should be considered before IV fluids.</p>
<p>If IV fluids are required for fluid resuscitation of a child or infant with COVID-19 and sepsis then Ringer’s Lactate given at maintenance volume would be first choice unless there is hypotension or poor perfusion. If hypotension or poor perfusion is present then Ringers Lactate should be given cautiously at 10-20 ml/kg over 30-60 minutes to a maximum of 40 ml/kg. If Ringers Lactate is unavailable then 0.9% normal saline, 0.9%/5% dextrose saline or 5% dextrose could be used depending on availability. There are concerns about liberal fluid use in severe COVID-19 being associated with poorer outcomes. Children with significant respiratory compromise should be fluid restricted to 2/3rds maintenance to reduce the risk of ARDS.</p>
<p>Infants and children of mothers with COVID-19 should continue to breastfeed on demand, if clinically able.</p>
<h3 id="management-of-fever">Management of fever</h3>
<p>First line antipyretic for children with a fever should be paracetamol. There is currently no significant evidence that ibuprofen is associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. If ibuprofen is prescribed regularly for a pre-existing medical condition (e.g. for rheumatoid arthritis) then this should be continued. Tepid sponging is not recommended.</p>
<h3 id="bacterial-infection">Bacterial infection</h3>
<p>Children who have signs and symptoms of sepsis at any stage in their illness, severe pneumonia or if they are not clinically improving, should be assessed for possible bacterial infection and started on IV ceftriaxone following blood cultures within an hour of assessment. Duration of antibiotics should be guided by clinical course and blood culture results. All children with suspected PIMS-TS should also be given IV ceftriaxone and oral clindamycin until their BC results are reported.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-of-children-with-covid-19-infection">Monitoring of children with COVID-19 infection</h3>
<p>Hospitalised children need regular vital signs to identify deterioration, use the MEWS score and alert senior nurse or doctor if MEWS &gt;5</p>
<h3 id="treatments-to-avoid-in-covid-19">Treatments to avoid in COVID-19</h3>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Although recommended for adults, the following medical treatments are not routinely recommended in children and may, in fact, have more side effects than potential beneficial effects: bronchodilators, steroids, antivirals and diuretics.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have not been shown to be harmful to children with COVID-19 infections. Patients taking ACE inhibitors for a pre-existing condition should continue them.</p>
</div></li>

<h2 id="pims-ts-also-known-as-mis-c-in-usa">PIMS-TS (also known as MIS-C in USA)</h2>
<p>Features of this illness are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and bacterial sepsis. It appears to be a delayed immune response to SARS-Co-V2 and is more frequent in patients of Black or Asian and those who are &gt; 75<sup>th</sup> centile for weight. It has been reported in children of all ages, Children usually present with persistent high-grade fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. Respiratory involvement is absent. Children &lt; 5 years present with a more typical Kawasaki picture and older children with myocarditis/pancarditis and shock. Children may have had symptoms of COVID-19 in the preceding weeks but they may have had an asymptomatic infection. Most cases recover quickly but deaths have been reported.</p>

<h3 id="management-of-pims-ts">Management of PIMS-TS:</h3>
<p>If you are suspecting PIMS-TS then use cautious IV fluids as there may be a rapid progression to pulmonary oedema as well as hypotension being refractory to fluids. 10ml/kg fluid boluses with reassessment for response should be used with maximum 30ml/kg. Inform the consultant if fluid boluses are required.</p>
<p>Steroids and / or aspirin can be used but should be a consultant led decision. Aspirin should be used in criteria for Kawasaki disease are fulfilled, with doses as per BNF:</p>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Neonate 8 mg/kg QDS</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Child &gt; 1 month 10 mg/kg QDS</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with PIMS-TS will require close outpatient follow-up and a repeat ECHO 4-6 weeks after discharge.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>Clinical trials for COVID-19 are ongoing so please consider whether the patient is eligible and contact the relevant research team.</p>
<h3 id="palliative-care">Palliative care</h3>
<p>Please see separate guideline for advice on symptom-control and other considerations for the dying patient.</p>
<h3 id="discharge">Discharge</h3>
<p>Self-isolation of a child will need to follow Ministry of Health guidance where possible but this may need to be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Patients who have been critically unwell, especially if they have had PIMS-TS, will need follow up in the clinic and this should be determined by the consultant team.</p>
<h2 id="key-issues-for-nursing-care">Key Issues for Nursing care</h2>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>All the routine precautions for caring for patients with COVID-19 apply, see relevant guidelines.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Given increased demand on staffing and for the comfort of the children, it will still be important for children 15 years and under to have an escort present even if their escort is confirmed negative or asymptomatic.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Adults and children may be cohorted together on the same wards. Where possible, all children should be grouped together and be near to the nurses station to maintain their safety.</p>
